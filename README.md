# bayes_mktg
Bayesian quant marketing code library

This is not yet a package, but may evolve into one at some point. It is a holding tank for commonly used code. It is the answer to the question: "Where can I get an optimized hierarchical mutlinomial logit estimation routine in Stan?" 

In other words it is bayesm 2.0.

Q: Can I submit something? 
A: Yes, please do it!

Q: How do I submit? 
A: Make a folder and put all the scripts you need to run a toy example: 
 * Ideally you'd include real data, but simulated data is fine too. 
 * Include a `Readme.md` explaining how to run the toy example. 
 * Fork + clone the repo, add your new folder, submit a pull request.
 
We will attempt to bring some editorial unity to the style across the different contributions. So far "we" means me, but hopefully not for long!
