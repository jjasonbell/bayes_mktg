Multivariate probit is an approach to modeling pick any J survey data, where respondents can check multiple boxes in a question.

These scripts run using simulated data. The inputs are:

 * $K$, the number of variables in the design matrix X.
 * D, the dimension of the output y.
 * N, the number of respondents.
 * y is a matrix of size N x D.
 * X is a matrix of size N x K.
